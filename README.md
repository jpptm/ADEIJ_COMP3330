# ADEIJ_COMP3330
## The group project for COMP3330 SEM 1 2023


For this group project, we can split it into multiple parts:

1) Data preprocessing and loading
    This involves scrubbing through the data, cleaning it, splitting it and applying any augmentations for the model. Wil also involve the part where we have to load it     so that the neural network can process it easily. Quite important as trash data will always result to a trash model.
    
2) Network architecture
    This part of the project will require someone investigating the network structure that we can use to train our model. __Lectures for weeks 5-6__ offer some pretty
    good pathway to ensure that any model is optimally trained.
    
3) Learning process
    This part will require a member / members to write code for the training, validation and testing process. They will also be responsible for history logging for           losses and accuracies as well as any visualisations needed.
    
4) Inference
    Test the model on a dataset separate from the training set. This is how we'll know how bad or good we are doing
    

*NB: The people who will be doing network architecture will have to make sure that the code for the network class can be easily scaled and transformed with NO repercussions to training. We also want to train multiple models with it. We should be able to easily change our network if we wanted to and we won't have to rewrite the whole code base.*

__Based on my conversations with each member, here's the initial allocation of work: __

Adebayo/Montano - 1) Data preprocessing and loading

Adebayo/Bird/Herfel - 3) Learning process

Bird/Herfel/Konijn - 2) Network architecture

Konijn/Montano - 4) Inference

The allocations above are your formal (initial) responsibilities. If you would like to change it around, please don't hesitate to tell me. These are just formalities, you can still work on something your interested in if your allocation does not happen to interest you.

__ We are a team, hence we will be helping anyone who needs assistance. __

The framework that we will be using is PyTorch so that we can easily copy code from the labs. I don't wish the pain tensorflow has done to me even to my enemies LOL!

Please make forks of main and publish your branches as pull requests. Changes are just easier to make and track with that method.

Any changes/questions, please tell me.
