python version 3.10.8 confirmed working for the inference script

If the following errors appear when running the inference script:
aten::empty_strided
aten::scaled_dot_product_attention

please uninstall your current torch distribution and

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
(for pytorch 2.0.1+cu118)

and try running the inference again. 

This error happens when incompatible versions of torch are installed.
In the submission, 2 models were included. One is meant for Nvidia GPU's and one is for CPU.

If your system has a cuda compatible nvidia GPU, please ignore the following as if you have successfully installed the correct packages and their correct versions,
there should be no need to use the CPU model.

GPU models are models that were saved using torch.jit while the device was in the GPU hence if a system does not have a cuda compatible NVIDIA GPU the model cannot be
loaded properly. Hence another model that was moved to the CPU before saving was created as well to make sure a model can be used. For more information, please visit https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/33212

If you do not have a cuda compatible GPU and the script does not run, please download the following packages after uninstalling your current distribution:

torch==2.0.1+cpu
torchaudio==2.0.2+cpu
torchvision==0.15.2+cpu

and run the inference script as is.

On our pseudo-test set of 3000 labelled images from the unlabelled seg_pred directory, the GPU model achieved an accuracy of 85.77%
The CPU model achieved an accuracy of 84.53%
